# Technical test for front-end dev position

This is a React app I built for a technical interview for a front-end developer position. The requirements were straightforward: build a front-end display for the products in the company's API. 

I chose to use React because of its responsivity and state functions. In other words, I only need to run a single API call—when the main  component loads—to access the information needed. Then, this information is stored in the componenet's state, making it very easy to work with. This cuts down on REST loading times as only one call is made per session.

Obviously, this app lacks a solid design and had I been given more time, I would have worked on that. When it comes to development, I like to nail down the functionalities first and then work on the visual aspect. This app meets all the requirements: it displays a table of all products, organized by the correct columns and it also has a product component, to see the full details of each item.

_The app will probably stop working when the company token that I was provided, expires._
